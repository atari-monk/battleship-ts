1. Generate game modes, 2 players, player - ai  
   Add a way to choose the game mode.  
   Distracted by taking unrelated notes.
2. Generate simple AI  
   Randomly hits field that was not hit yet.
3. Refactor by chatgpt code review.  
   Fail, refactoring caused vite, webpack not to work, changes discarded.
4. Make sure it works better with vite.  
   Seems this removed problem with vite.
5. Refactor code
6. Generate advanced AI
   AI is a complex task.  
   This time I left my usual strategy of producing 1000 classes to "simplify problem".  
   This time I have 2 files and just did new functions for AI.  
   It slowly grows if done step by step, like working with clay.
7. Make log format workable again (shorter)
