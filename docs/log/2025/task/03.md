## 01

1. Add check for already attacked cell.  
   Note: Jest test only runs with correct test name (x.test.ts).
2. Implement game modes: 2 players, player vs AI.

## 02

1. Implement game modes: 2 players, player vs AI.  
   Add option to choose the game mode.  
   Got distracted with unrelated notes.
2. Generate simple AI that randomly hits unhit cells.
3. Refactor based on ChatGPT code review.  
   Failedâ€”refactoring broke Vite and Webpack, changes discarded.
4. Fix Vite issue.
5. Refactor code.
6. Generate advanced AI.  
   AI is complex. Shifted from creating 1000 classes to simplifying the problem.  
   Two files and new functions for AI, progress step-by-step.
7. Make log format usable again.
8. Shorten log further.
9. Convert time log to JSON and calculate with Python.
10. Create script to generate new \_in.json file monthly.
11. Fix time calculation script to automatically use the current month without user input.

## 03

1. Generate advanced AI.  
   State machine with switchable strategies.  
   Put visuals on web page.  
   Partitioned one big file to subsystem named files (config, loop, logic, render, input).  
   Added Next button. It allows to stop game loop and see ai move on its grid.

## 04

1. Generate advanced AI.  
   Tested Random strategy sinking ship. Fixed ending game bug.  
   Tested strategy for finding ship orientation.
2. Hide inputs in ai turn.  
   Improved logging in page and console.  
   Improved project docs structure.
3. Sort type files to type folders.
4. Make buttons react to enter.  
   Input focus, buttons handle enter one after another.

## 05

1. Is conversion form json to jsonl for my time stats smart ?  
   No, this is just one moth data, human readable format is better for small data object.  
   Jsonl can append to file simpler, reads object as line.  
   Json read whole file as array of objects, appends and overrides whole file.  
   For small data set i prefer human readable format.
2. Turn off player to test AI. Brute force commenting code out.
3. Strategy to find ends of ship, to sink it, knowing orientation.  
   Add empty strategy first.  
   Trying to hit next to first 2 hits that determine ship orientation.
   Doc describing strategies, testing.

- Refactor project_configuration.md document.
- Restore configurable Console mode.
- Investigate why i cant use lib HitResult in client logic.
- Publish.
- Reflect.
